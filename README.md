# MC simulation of the 3d U(1) lattice gauge theory

This project performs a Monte Carlo simulation of the 3d U(1) lattice gauge theory implementing the Metropolis, Glauber and Heatbath algorithms.
We measure obervables such as the plaquette value and the topological charge density (to be implemented).
